## What is the VTA Trip Planner?

VTA's new trip planner is Santa Clara County’s first complete trip planning and comparison tool to help you explore your best travel options. It allows multi modal transportation options, and includes intermodal trip planning, i.e. one trip using bicycling and transit combined.  Real time vehicle information is included in the trip details for those vehicles in your trip.

The VTA Trip planner was developed as part of VTA’s Innovation in Transportation Initiative.  It was developed and implemented with the assistance and guidance of [AmigoCloud](https://www.amigocloud.com/homepage/index).  

The trip planner uses open transportation data standards and technologies, including:

* The [OpenTripPlanner](http://www.opentripplanner.org/) multimodal routing engine.
* [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and the import process to add [VTA data to Open Street Map](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/VTA_Transportation).
* [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) Transit data feeds from the following providers: AC Transit, Altamont Corridor Express (ACE), BART, CALTRAIN, Capitol Corridor, County Connection (Contra Costa County), Golden Gate Ferry, Golden Gate Transit, Marin Transit, Modesto Area Express, SAMTRANS, San Benito County Express, Santa Cruz Metro, SFMTA, Sonoma County Transit.  Additional providers will be added as data is available.
* [Baseline Code](https://github.com/conveyal/modeify) developed by [Conveyal](http://conveyal.com/).
